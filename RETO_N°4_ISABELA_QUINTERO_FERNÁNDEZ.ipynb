            "1. Introduction\n",
            "2020 represented a turning point for the global economy, and Colombia was no exception. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic generated an unprecedented health crisis that drastically impacted supply chains, international trade relations, and domestic demand. In this context, Colombian foreign trade presented a series of specific characteristics that are worth analyzing in depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Colombian Foreign Trade\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating effect on the Colombian economy, causing an economic contraction unprecedented since the Great Depression. The lockdown and social distancing measures implemented by the government to contain the spread of the virus paralyzed economic activity and generated a sharp drop in demand.\n",
            "Main consequences of the pandemic on Colombian foreign trade:\n",
            "Decrease in global trade: Restrictions on the movement of people and goods, as well as border closures, caused a significant contraction in global trade, directly affecting Colombian exports and imports.\n",
            "Disruption of supply chains: The pandemic exposed the fragility of global supply chains, generating product shortages in some sectors and increasing production costs for Colombian companies.\n",
            "Increased uncertainty: The heightened uncertainty generated by the pandemic discouraged investment and consumption, affecting demand for imported products and Colombian exports.\n",
            "Acceleration of e-commerce: The pandemic boosted the growth of e-commerce in Colombia, as consumers turned to online shopping to purchase goods and services, creating new opportunities for Colombian companies.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Key Trends in Colombian Foreign Trade in 2020\n",
            "Declining Exports: Colombian exports contracted due to falling commodity prices, especially oil, and lower external demand, primarily in sectors such as the automotive and manufacturing sectors.\n",
            "Decreasing Imports: Imports also declined, reflecting lower economic activity and falling investment.\n",
            "Greater Dependence on Some Markets: Colombia remained dependent on the United States and the European Union as its main export destinations.\n",
            "Strengthening E-Commerce: As globally, e-commerce experienced significant growth in Colombia, generating new opportunities for Colombian companies.\n",
            "Agro-industrial Sector as a Growth Driver: The agro-industrial sector showed greater resilience, with some products such as coffee and Hass avocado registering growth in their exports.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Sector Analysis\n",
            "Mining and Energy Sector: This sector, traditionally one of the pillars of Colombian exports, suffered a severe impact due to the drop in oil prices and lower global energy demand.\n",
            "Manufacturing Sector: The manufacturing sector was affected by lower domestic and external demand, especially in sectors such as automotive and textiles. However, some subsectors, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, experienced growth due to increased demand associated with the pandemic.\n",
            "Agroindustrial Sector: Despite the adverse context, the agroindustrial sector showed greater resilience, with some products such as coffee and Hass avocado registering growth in their exports.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Challenges and Opportunities for the Future\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to diversify economies, strengthen supply chains, and promote innovation. For Colombia, the main challenges include:\n",
            "Recovery of global demand: The recovery of the global economy will be essential to boosting the growth of Colombian foreign trade.\n",
            "Adaptation to new technologies: The digitalization of trade and the adoption of new technologies will be key to improving the competitiveness of Colombian companies.\n",
            "Strengthening institutions: Building strong and transparent institutions is essential to attracting foreign investment and fostering private sector development.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Opportunities:\n",
            "Development of new markets: The crisis has generated new opportunities to explore new markets and diversify exports.\n",
            "Promotion of local production: The pandemic has highlighted the importance of local production and food security.\n",
            "Strengthening regional cooperation: Regional cooperation can help countries address common challenges and seize opportunities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Joint activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Conclusions\n",
            "2020 was a year of great challenges for Colombian foreign trade. However, it also represented an opportunity to rethink the economic development model and strengthen the economy's resilience. The recovery of the global economy and the implementation of appropriate public policies will be essential to seize the opportunities that arise in the coming years.\n",

        "\n",
        "**ANALDEX** hace referencia a la Asociación Nacional de Comercio Exterior (antes conocida como la Asociación Nacional de Exportadores), es una entidad sin animo de lucro de naturaleza privada que tiene como objetivo fomentar y fortalecer la actividad exportadora nacional, apoyar el diseño y la ejecución de políticas de exportación de corto, mediano y largo plazo. Analdex asesora a los empresarios para que las exportaciones sean un mejor negocio y ayuda en la definición de estrategias de comercio exterior. De igual manera, incentiva la cultura exportadora y la competitividad. En la actualidad, esta asociación representa la voz de empresas exportadoras, importadoras, agencias de aduana, puertos, zonas francas, entre otras.\n",
        "\n",
        "Esta Asociación es la encargada de realizar los informes anuales en términos de comercio exterior para ofrecer un panorama general de como se comportó Colombia en términos de relaciones internacionales y negocios. Los informes para el año 2020, 2021, 2022 y 2023 son los que se evaluaron en este análisis de sentimientos. A continuación un breve resumen del contenido de cada informe:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   En **2020**, el comercio exterior colombiano cayó drásticamente por el COVID-19, afectando exportaciones e importaciones, especialmente en los sectores minero-energético y manufacturero. Se destacó la resiliencia del agro y la importancia del comercio digital.\n",
        "\n",
        "* En **2021**, comenzó la recuperación gracias a la reapertura económica y el alza en precios de materias primas. Hubo mayor diversificación en exportaciones, pero persistieron desafíos como problemas en la cadena de suministro y baja competitividad.\n",
        "\n",
        "* En **2022**, la recuperación continuó, aunque afectada por la inflación y la guerra en Ucrania. Creció el comercio electrónico y los acuerdos comerciales fueron clave. El sector minero-energético se benefició del alza en precios, pero con retos ambientales.\n",
        "\n",
        "* En **2023**, el comercio exterior se estabilizó, pero con desafíos como la desaceleración global. La digitalización y la sostenibilidad emergieron como claves para fortalecer la competitividad del país.\n",
        "\n",
        "El análisis de sentimiento pretendía evaluar cada informe y definir su tono emocional positivo, negativo o neutro para cada caso. Se evaluaron con respecto a 6 sentimientos: \"Amenaza\", \"Pesimismo\", \"Inestabilidad\", \"Esceptisismo\", \"Indiferente\", \"Neutral\", \"Favorable\", \"Optimismo\", \"Convicción\", \"Consolidación\", \"Confianza\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Para el año **2020**, los sentimientos predominantes fueron convicción y consolidación, con 6 frases cada uno, seguidos de inestabilidad y optimismo, con 5 frases. Esto refleja el impacto negativo del COVID-19 en el comercio exterior colombiano, generando incertidumbre y desafíos. Sin embargo, a pesar de la crisis, el informe evidencia una postura de resiliencia y confianza en la capacidad del país para superar los retos y recuperar su estabilidad económica.\n",
        "\n",
        "Para el año **2021**, el optimismo fue el sentimiento más recurrente, con 7 frases, reflejando la recuperación económica tras un año de pandemia e inestabilidad. Este panorama se refuerza con el sentimiento de convicción, presente en 6 frases, que, al igual que en 2020, muestra la confianza de los colombianos en la mejora del país. Además, el sentimiento favorable, con 5 menciones, indica avances y crecimiento en el comercio exterior gracias a la reapertura económica y la diversificación de exportaciones, evidenciando una visión más positiva tras un año desafiante.\n",
        "\n",
        "Para el año **2022**, el sentimiento más predominante fue convicción, con 5 frases, reflejando la confianza en la continuidad del crecimiento económico a pesar de los desafíos globales. Le sigue consolidación, con 4 frases, indicando estabilidad en ciertos sectores del comercio exterior, especialmente en los acuerdos comerciales, que jugaron un papel clave en la dinámica económica del país. Además, los sentimientos favorable y optimismo, con 3 frases cada uno, evidencian una percepción positiva sobre las oportunidades de expansión y desarrollo, aunque aún con cierta cautela frente a los retos ambientales y de sostenibilidad reflejando el puntaje de 3 frases de inestabilidad en el análisis de sentimientos.\n",
        "\n",
        "Para el año **2023**, los sentimientos predominantes fueron convicción y consolidación, con 4 frases cada uno, reflejando la confianza en la estabilidad del comercio exterior y la adaptación del país a un entorno global desafiante, fortaleciendo la competitividad colombiana. Además, los sentimientos favorable y optimismo, con 3 frases cada uno, indican una visión positiva sobre las oportunidades de crecimiento, reflejando la ambición por generar más crecimiento y seguir fortaleciendo la presencia de Colombia en un entorno internacional.\n",
        "\n",
        "En general, durante estos cuatro años, el sentimiento de **convicción** ha sido una constante en los informes de ANALDEX, con un total de 21 frases. Este patrón sugiere una postura firme y confiada por parte de la Asociación en la capacidad de Colombia para enfrentar desafíos y fortalecer su comercio exterior, incluso en momentos de crisis como la pandemia por COVID-19. Este sentimiento se ve respaldado por el **optimismo** (18 frases) y la **consolidación** (17 frases), reflejando una visión positiva y esperanzadora sobre el futuro del comercio internacional del país. La confianza en la consolidación de la industria colombiana dentro del entorno global demuestra el compromiso de ANALDEX con el crecimiento y la estabilidad del sector. Sin embargo, la **inestabilidad** sigue siendo un factor presente, con 12 frases a lo largo de los cuatro años, lo que indica que, aunque hay avances, persisten desafíos importantes. La incertidumbre política y económica ha sido un obstáculo recurrente, dificultando el proceso de desarrollo y afectando la confianza en el panorama comercial a largo plazo.\n",
        "\n",
        "Con este análisis de sentimientos pudimos clasificar y entender como a lo largo de estos cuatro años la postura por parte de Analdex ha cambiado o se ha mantenido en relación con el contexto global, permitiendo una visión general del panorama colombiano y el tono emocional por parte de sus informes.\n"
